## Building the package

To build the package from source clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cyberlytics/iaria-lite.git
```

and run `make`:

```bash
$ make dist
```

This will create the zip file `dist/iaria-lite.zip` with the complete installation package as it can be downloaded from CTAN.

All build artifacts without the archive itself can be build with:

```bash
$ make compile
```

The repository can be cleaned up with:

```bash
$ make clean
```

## The source files

* `doc/iaria-lite.tex` The user documentation of the iaria-lite class

* `src/iaria-lite.cls` The LaTeX class of the package
* `static` All files that will be added unchanged to the CTAN package like `README` and template sources
