              -----------------------------
              Version 0.5 of the iaria-lite class
                  Christoph P. Neumann
              -----------------------------

This package contains templates for the creation of documents for
IARIA publications (International Academy, Research, and Industry Association)
and implements the specifications for the IARIA citation style.

This class does not contain evil low-level TeX magic
but instead uses many other fancy LaTeX packages
that we hope you have already installed.

It does not implement the specifications for the IARIA citation style,
for which you have to use the iaria class.

DISCLAIMER: If your are using pdflatex/biblatex/biber,
it is recommended to use CTAN package iaria.
